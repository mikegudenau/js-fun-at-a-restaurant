# JS Fun at a Restaurant

## Overview

Part 2 (optional extra) of our first project at Turing, we were assigned Fun in the Library, unit testing. During this project, we gained experience working with variables, primitive data types, looping, arrays, and objects.

In this project, you'll be gaining experience working with variables, primitive
data types, looping, arrays, and objects. As you work through the
iterations, be sure to take time to stop and refactor you solutions. There is
rarely one right way to solve a problem in programming, and part of your job
will be evaulating the trade offs between different approaches to solving a
problem.

## Learning goals

- Understand what JavaScript primitives are, and how/when to use them
- Practice using objects and arrays, including for loops
- Understand JavaScript data types and how/when to use them
- Write functions that require conditional logic, parameters/arguments, and return
- Read and understand unit tests, and pass them

## Setup

  - Fork this project to your own Github account
  - clone the repository to your local machine
  - `cd` into the project
  - run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
